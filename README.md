# interactive-prototype
Created an interactive prototype using Figma to simulate user flow across three app screens: Login, Dashboard, and Add Task. Navigation was implemented using Prototype mode, enabling smooth transitions. This task demonstrates how users interact with the UI, providing a functional preview of the appâ€™s behavior without writing any code.
